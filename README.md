# Bigmart-Sales-Presdiction-Machine-Learning
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.This project aims to predict sales using big data analytics. The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data along with other relevant features such as date, store location, promotions, and competitors' prices.
